How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    because it let you see both version on de code and highlight the difference between both.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    because if anything happens to the programs in a certain time, you could take an old version of the same
    program that didnt have the bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    		you wont do it by accident
    		it let other to see what you actually did before changing anything

    Cons:




Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    we are writing a program, so if it needs a database file or multiple scripts writed 
    in different language its better to save it all together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    to see the differences that has been made throught time

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because if anythings happens you could just download an old filed that doesnt have 
    the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Make my first commit
