When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are adding a new feature and you want to test it before commit it in the master
	branch

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes there wont be a need to pull, because the remote
	and master will be up to date.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks:
			You make a clone of repository but only on github servers, not local
	Clones:
			You take a repository and "Download" it to your computer, but github does not create
			a repository of the clone in github servers
	Branches:
			They are like routes that a repository can take when adding new features or 
			changing some buggy behaviours on a code.

	I would use fork when i want to create a new repository of my own, from someones repository.
	i would use clone when cloning a repository of mine, to testet it locally.
 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To keep track of the history of all the changes that has been made.
