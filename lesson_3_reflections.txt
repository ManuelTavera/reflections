when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are adding a new feature and you want to test it before commit it in the master
	branch

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes there wont be a need to pull, because the remote
	and master will be up to date.
